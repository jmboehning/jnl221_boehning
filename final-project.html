		<h3>A look into a growing teacher shortage crisis</h3>
			<p>United States public schools are experiencing a severe shortage of teachers, with <a href="https://tsa.ed.gov/#/home/" target="_blank">data</a> from the Department of Education indicating a significant rise in critical teacher shortage areas (TSAs) over the past two decades.<br><br>In the 2022-2023 academic year, U.S. states and territories identified over 1,300 critical areas — an over 200% increase from the amount reported for 2000-2001.<br><br>This data is part of an ongoing initiative by the DOE, where they have had states submit TSA reports since the 1990-1991 academic year. Neither the DOE nor media outlets have typically used this data to evaluate the state of the ongoing crisis.<br><br>The reports suggest that teacher shortages peaked during the 2017-2018 school year, with the DOE identifying over 2,200 TSAs across US states and territories. Although this number has decreased since then, it has not returned to pre-spike levels.</p>

				</script>
			<p> Dr. Freddie Cross, an educational statistician for the DOE, explained the collection process in a written statement to JNL 221 — describing how the organization evaluates state “projections” to compile this data.<br><br>“(States) may use data up to three years old to make their determinations and base them on unfilled positions, positions filled by teachers trained in a different subject area and uncertified teachers,” Cross wrote. <br><br>Cross also said the DOE primarily utilizes the data to determine federal funding for educational programs, though "states are not (legally) mandated" to fill out these reports.<br><br> Although the COVID-19 pandemic brought the topic into public discourse, teacher shortages have been a persistent issue in the US. In fact, the DOE data suggests the number of reported teacher shortage areas has decreased by around 18% within the past five years. However, it is still sitting at a level significantly higher than ever before.<br><br>In August 2022, several major news outlets <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/08/24/teacher-shortages-pipeline-college-licenses/" target="_blank">covered</a> a Brown University <a href="https://www.teachershortages.com/" target="_blank">report</a> which suggested there may be over 50,000 actively vacant teaching positions across the country, an estimate it described as “conservative.”<br><br>Within the paper, authors Dr. Tuan D. Nguyen, Dr. Chanh B. Lam and Dr. Paul Bruno also mentioned the lack of consistent and accessible federal data regarding the crisis, which they said made it difficult to quantify.<br><br>“Despite the many reports of teacher shortages, there has not been a concerted effort to examine teacher shortages and turnover nationally,” their report reads.<br><br>Following this report, the Biden-Harris administration released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-public-and-private-sector-actions-to-strengthen-teaching-profession-and-help-schools-fill-vacancies/" target="_blank">statement</a> outlining several initiatives it planned to implement to fill teacher vacancies, including issuing a letter to state governments promoting higher pay and better working conditions for public school teachers — especially in low-income areas.<br><br>This statement has had little effect on the prevalence of teacher shortages, as the DOE TSA data suggests the 2022-2023 school year, which was after its release, had more critical areas than 2021-2022.<br><br>In Nov. 2023, the White House put out another <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-premiers-public-service-announcement-elevating-teaching-profession" target="_blank">statement</a>, which it said would build on their previous commitments. The release mentions strategies the Biden-Harris administration has employed to combat teacher shortages but does not provide updated statistics about their prevalence.<br><br>With a lack of easily accessible federal data and action from states, the teacher shortage epidemic will likely continue without further outside intervention.

		<h3>Combatting teacher shortages</h3>
			<img src="darling-hammond.jpg" alt="An image of Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond sitting on a couch and listening to someone speak" width="350px" height="300px">
			<p>Several public interest groups have developed datasets and pushed their own initiatives to combat teacher shortages, one of the key players being the <a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Learning Policy Institute</a> — a non-profit educational research institute based in California.<br><br>The group has released several reports about teacher shortage areas, including “<a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/federal-role-ending-teacher-shortages-report" target="_blank">The Federal Role in Ending Teacher Shortages</a>” and “<a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/state-teacher-shortages-vacancy-resource-tool" target="_blank">State Teacher Shortages: Teaching Positions Left Vacant or Filled by Teachers Without Full Certification</a>.”<br><br>Most notably, the group published a 2018 <a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/body/Teacher_Shortages_Causes_Impacts_2018_MEMO.pdf" target="_blank">memo</a> outlining the “causes” and “impacts” of teacher shortages, which also coincides with the reported TSA spike of the previous academic year.<br><br>Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, LPI’s president and CEO, wrote about some of these causes in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindadarlinghammond/2023/01/05/policymakers-should-ring-in-the-new-year-with-action-to-end-teacher-shortages/?sh=75547ad66d35" target="_blank">piece</a>  she contributed to Forbes in 2023. Throughout the article, she compares the US with other education systems, points out places where it is lacking and offers potential solutions.<br><br>“This year’s crop of back-to-school stories has been dominated by the news of teacher resignations leading to widespread teacher shortages,” Darling-Hammond wrote.<br><br>In the piece, which also references the DOE TSA <a href="https://tsa.ed.gov/#/home/" target="_blank">data</a>, Darling-Hammond said teachers are leaving the profession because of low salary levels, “poor teacher conditions,” lack of autonomy in the workplace, few opportunities for leadership and professional development, test-based assessment and a “lack of influence over school policies and practices.”<br><br>She also said these reasons are “symptoms of a de-professionalized occupation.”<br><br>Darling-Hammond also highlighted the disproportionate effects these shortages have on low-income students and students of color, as they have “disproportionately” caused their communities to need to hire underqualified applicants, she said.<br><br>Darling-Hammond and other leaders at the LPI said they believe the federal government should provide incentives, such as providing more financial support systems and establishing a tax credit system for teachers, to increase the number of people pursuing a career in teaching.<br><br>“The importance of teachers to students and society cannot be overstated,” Darling-Hammond wrote. “Our investments in teachers are investments in our children and in our collective future.”

		<h3>The "West Virginia outlier:" Explaining potential discrapancies and limitations to TSA data</h3>
			<p>When looking at the data, an outlier emerged — West Virginia. Over the selected 23-year span, the state reported over 4,000 critical teacher shortage areas — significantly more than any other state.<br><br>The outlier was also inconsistent across the years. For a majority of the dataset, West Virginia reported a steady increase in TSAs consistent with states of similar populations; that was, until the 2018-2019 academic year.<br><br>During this school year, West Virginia predicted over 550 critical areas — a significant jump from the 90 it reported the year before. Since that point, their total has consistently sat between 400 and 700.</p>
			<iframe title="West Virginia reported a significantly majority of US's critical teacher shortage areas over the past 23 years" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-fPpmH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fPpmH/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="574" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
			<p>After discovering this notable outlier, our team looked into several potential reasons to explain it.<br><br>Many media outlets in West Virginia have similarly reported the increased prevelance of teacher shortages in the state. Dale Lee, the president of West Virginia Education Association, <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2023/08/15/a-teacher-shortage-continues-to-plague-west-virginia-schools/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to WV MetroNews that the state expected 1,700 vacant teaching positions in the 2023-2024 school year.<br><br>“We’re such a border state. You can make anywhere from four thousand to 20 thousand dollars more by driving across the state line. Our young teachers are leaving,” Lee said to MetroNews, describing a pay gap between the state and its surrounding area.<br><br>However, other US states recieved equal and greater media attention for their teacher shortage crises. Among national publications, West Virginia was typically <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/12/21/why-there-teacher-shortage-schools-struggled-nationwide-2022/10882103002/" target="_blank">not mentioned</a> as one of the top critical areas.<br><br>Consequently, the perceived jump in West Virginia TSAs could also have to do with changes in their internal data collection practices, as the US DOE relies on individual states to report these areas.<br><br>Because the federal government does not legally require states to produce this data, their reports may vary in thoroughness and accuracy. When submitting, states can also opt to fill out more details within their reports — such as school district and subject area of the vacany.<br><br>When asked about their increase in TSA reports, West Virginia DOE did not follow up on a request for comment.</p>

	<h3>Moving forward</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.nctq.org/publications/Do-States-Have-the-Data-they-Need-to-Answer-Important-Questions-about-their-Teacher-Workforce" target="_blank">lack</a> of consistency in data collection, federal databases and government-sponsored organizations dedicated to directly logging these shortage areas make the issue immensley challenging to track. Limited data make it difficult to understand the scope of the teacher shortage epidemic in the US.<br><br>Making datasets more accessible and open is crucial for the US government to identify and address at-risk areas, but it is lacking. The TSA data is likely only a small look into the true extent of America's ongoing crisis.</p>
